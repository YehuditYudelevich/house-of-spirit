House of Spirit is a heap exploitation technique used in binary exploitation. 
It targets the memory management of dynamic memory allocators like malloc.
The attacker manipulates a dangling pointer to point to a fake chunk of memory controlled by them.
When the program attempts to free or reallocate this fake chunk, the attacker gains control over the programâ€™s execution flow. 
This technique is commonly used to achieve arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation in vulnerable software.
